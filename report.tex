\section{Introduction}

We both attend japanese language classes. We noticed that there are services
offering translations, but not definition of a symbol or a group of them.
As we learn more kanji we would get help for chosen ones only.
There exist plugins that provide similar functionality, but they usually
work in a browser only.

We decided to design and implement an Android application that would
provide dictionary definition for anything that appears on a screen.
