\section{Introduction}

We both attend japanese language classes. We noticed that there are services
offering translations, but not definition of a symbol or a group of them.
As we learn more kanji we would get help for chosen ones only.
There exist plugins that provide similar functionality, but they usually
work in a browser only.

We decided to design and implement an Android application that would
provide dictionary definition for anything that appears on a screen.

\section{Tests, problems}

During the course of our work we stumbled upon following issues:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Android's API for Asistant is not documented
    \item most Android testing frameworks do not support Assistant testing
    \item Assist Application implementation is not popular
    \item user can use only one Assistant at the time
\end{itemize}
